# Handwritting-Classifier

Designed and implemented the CNN model for classifying handwritten characters inputed as numbers between 0-9. The model is written using python and Keras and uses Tensorflow Backend. Model gives an accuracy of 98%(approx) for 10 epochs. 

Also, Built an iOS application where users can draw any characters on the screen and get the predicted result. The application uses the above mentioned neural net model using the CoreML and Vision libraries.
